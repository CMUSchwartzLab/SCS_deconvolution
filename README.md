This is the top level directory for the repository

https://github.com/CMUSchwartzLab/SCS_deconvolution

that contains software to solve several formulations of the problem of
deconvolving bulk tumor data into subpopulations, as described in (Lei
et al., in preparation)

Code and more information can be found in the subdirectory
