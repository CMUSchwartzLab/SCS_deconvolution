In this specific DateFolder, we included the deconvolution results of the samples in simulation directory. We only run DecomposeSolver.py on 3 tumor samples for both GBM07 and GBM33 just to show how the output would look like.

The results will be stored in directories as follows:

If the user works on bulk data simulated from Simulated SCS data and since the TumorName was specified with the prefix `simulated_`, the directory would be like:
```
results/DateFolder/simulated_GBM07/3/gurobi/result0alpha0.2.mat
                                           /result1alpha0.2.mat
                                    /nmf/result0alpha0.2.mat
                                        /result1alpha0.2.mat
                                  /6/...
                                  /9/...
                  /simulated_GBM07/3/gurobi/result0alpha0.2.mat
                                           /result1alpha0.2.mat
                                    /nmf/result0alpha0.2.mat
                                        /result1alpha0.2.mat
                                  /6/...
                                  /9/...
                                    ...                               
```
If the user has the real observed SCS data, and since the TumorName was specifed as `GBM07` or `GBM33`, and the directory structure would be like:
```
results/DateFolder/GBM07/3/gurobi/...
                          /nmf/...
                        /6/...
                        /9/...
                        ....
                  /GBM33/3/gurobi/...
                          /nmf/...
                        /6/...
                        /9/...
                        ....
```
The name of DateFolder and TumorName should be consistent as in the step of bulk data simulation. The name of the result file has two separated meanings:
- result0: the result comes from simulate_data_0 in simulation directory
- alpha0.2: the regularization parameter is set up to 0.2
