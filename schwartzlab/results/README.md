This directory and its subdirectories are used to store the results of copy mumber Deconvolution from the bulk data.

The one subdirectory named as `10_30` means the deconvolution results are from the bulk data that were simulated on `10_30_2018`. This would be consistent with the name of DateFolder the user specified in the previous steps
