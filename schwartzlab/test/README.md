# Test Script Directory

This directory and its subdirectories GTest and NTest are for storing
the scripts for submitting the job to the queue.

runDataSimulationGBM07.sh and runDataSimulationGBM33.sh are example
scripts to run DataSimulation.py; they contain some internal
documentation indicating what arguments the user has to change for the
user's installation of this entire repository.

Much more information can be found in
[../LLSolver/README.md](../LLSolver/README.md).
