# Test Script Directory

This directory and its subdirectories GTest and NTest are for storing
the scripts that call DecomposeSolver.py. When running the tests fo
the manuscrit, such scripts were submitted to a compute farm that accepts
bash scripts.

runDataSimulationGBM07.sh and runDataSimulationGBM33.sh are example
scripts to run DataSimulation.py; they contain some internal
documentation indicating what arguments the user has to change for the
user's installation of this entire repository.

Much more information can be found in
[../LLSolver/README.md](../LLSolver/README.md).
