This directory and its subdirectories GTest and NTest are for storing outputs of DataSimulation.py, which is the module that
creates the simulated bulk data as output from the input single cell data.

runDataSimulationGBM07.sh and  runDataSimulationGBM33.sh are example scripts to run DatSimulation.py; they contain some internal documentation indicating what arguments the user has to change for
the user's installation of this entire repository.

Much more information can be found in ../LLSolver/Readme.txt
