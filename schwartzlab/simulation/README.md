This directory and its subdirectories are used to store the simulated Bulk tumor data either from Simulated SCS data or real observed SCS data.

We included two replicates for each tumor sample cases in the corresponding subdirectory, please go to each subdirectory for detail.

The one subdirectory named as `10_30` means the Bulk data were simulated on the date of `10_30_2018`. This is to distinguish different simulation dataset and we prefer to use the date as the mark. The way of naming it depends on the user, however, we expect the user to be consistent when calling DecomposeSolver.py, in order to have correct path for input and output.
