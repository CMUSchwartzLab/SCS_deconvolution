For each of the two tumors GBM07 and GBM33, this directory contains
-- three input files for Simulate_SCS.py
-- one sample output file from Simulate_SCS.py

The files GBM07RegionDivide.csv and GBM33RegionDivide.csv indicate how many cells are in each of three regions of each tumor.
The files GBM07CopyNumberRate.csv and GBM33CopyNumberRate.csv show the probabilities of each copy number in {0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} in each of three regions of the tumor
The files GBM07PositionRate.csv and GBM33PositionRate.csv show the probabilities that each position has a copy number other than 2.
